The Resident's application is for doing the most common actions such as making payments, getting updates, and managing the account. These applications will allow me to submit multiple payments and message the company.

While I was paying the rent of my apartment I encountered a problem with paying with their app. The problem was that when I tried to pay, I needed to add a new card which the button called “**ADD A NEW ACCOUNT**” and would result in the session being closed and an error code being time out. This was a problem for me since I wanted to pay my rent on time before they charged me extra for a late fee. This situation escalates when the app starts to crash. This was an **Error Tolerance** since my roommates also experienced the same problem that we both encountered.

Our idea was that if we deleted the data and cleared the cache it might reset the application setting to factory, and then it would function properly. We did that and we were able to enter our card information into our account, but then it still timed out. Then we turned off the wifi setting and restarted the phone, which resulted in the application working properly and I could pay my rent on time. Our last scenario was **Efficiency** since we were debugging the situation to resolve it on time. By following all these steps we learn **Useful** troubleshooting steps that could be applied in a situation.
