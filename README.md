About me...
I'm a student who loves to explore around the cities and go on long trips. I'm the type of person who is willing to drive for 8 hours for no reason. I play a tremendous amount of video games and like to socialize. Hi this Miguel Ocampo and I'm computer science major, my hobbies are driving and playing video games.
